# FDM_vehicle_default_predictor

This repository contains a Data Mining mini project on Vehicle loan default prediction using Random tree classifier as an assignment for a data science undergraduate module at SLIIT

## Project Background:

This project investigates a real-world problem and proposes a solution for it using data mining and machine learning techniques. Therefore, the selected problem is associated with a loan offering company. 

‘The Ultima Auto Loan’ is a company that offers the loan is a non-financial company that is not supervised by national or international banking regulatory agencies and does not have a full banking license. The company is capable of offering financial services like investment, risk pooling, contractual savings, and market brokering.  

Due to the increase in loan defaults in the vehicle loan category the company has struggled to mark profit efficiently and had to face financial difficulties due to the unexpected loss. To prevent the difficulties the company has decided to determine the client’s loan repayment abilities and understand the relative importance of each parameter contributing to a borrower’s ability to repay the loan. Hereby analyzing historical data of lending loans for clients the model will predict whether the clients’ request will default (failed to repay the loan) on the vehicle payment or not based on observations.

This will help the company to predict whether the client can pay the amount in the given period and offer them the loan and also can reduce the financial loss that can happen because of clients default on payment.
